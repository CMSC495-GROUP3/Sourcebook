# Shared evidence sheet (position papers)

One table of figures for the Unit 8 individual position papers
([issue #217](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/issues/217)).
Every filled cell names the artifact or GitHub search it came from. Cells
without a committed artifact use
`Pending — requires <named artifact/gate>` and do not invent a number.

**Tag status:** `v1.0.0` is not cut. Code freezes on Monday 28 September, and
`main` at that point is the candidate
([plan on #215](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/issues/215#issuecomment-5824613941)).
Every final-release row below is Pending until it is measured on that
candidate. The alpha and beta rows link into the tagged trees, so they do not
move when `main` does. The rest of this folder (`README.md`, `coverage.md`)
and the release pages beside it (`handoff.md`, `release-notes.md`,
`live-evaluation.md`, `live-benchmark.md`) are drafted in
[pull request #274](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/274) and
are not on `main` yet.

**GitHub counts:** as of **2026-09-25T19:30Z** (the review column
2026-09-25T19:57Z), to be refreshed when `v1.0.0` is tagged. They
are live search totals, not values frozen by any commit, so they will grow
until the tag. Each Source cell gives the search, scoped to
`repo:CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook`. To regenerate, run the same query in the
GitHub search box, with `gh search prs` / `gh search issues`, or through the
search API, and read the total count. The earlier snapshot in
[docs/quality.md](../../../quality.md#live-pr-and-review-totals)
(2026-09-18, 122 merged pull requests) is superseded here.

## Coverage

| Figure | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python coverage %, final | Pending — requires the candidate's `python-coverage-<sha>` CI artifact copied into `evidence/coverage.md` ([issue #210](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/issues/210); file drafted in [#274](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/274)) | Floor today: `--cov-fail-under=80` in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../../../../.github/workflows/ci.yml); see [quality.md § Coverage](../../../quality.md#coverage) |
| Web coverage %, final | Pending — requires the candidate's `web-coverage-<sha>` CI artifact, same file and issue | Scope is the source files listed in `web/vitest.config.ts`, not all of `web/src`. Say so wherever the figure is quoted |
| Web coverage %, pre-freeze (five files only) | 99.46% statements; 96.42% branches; 100% functions; 99.37% lines. Scope is `useChat`, `Message`, `EscalateButton`, `ThemeToggle`, and `theme.ts` | [quality.md § Coverage](../../../quality.md#what-the-suite-covers-and-what-it-does-not), measured on the head of [pull request #252](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/252) before it merged. `web/vitest.config.ts` has since added the escalation files, so the final figure covers a wider scope than these five. Not the release figure; cite the final row once filled |

## Pull requests, reviews, and issues (to date)

As of 2026-09-25T19:30Z (the review column 2026-09-25T19:57Z), to be

How to read the columns:

- **Merged PRs authored** is `is:pr is:merged author:<login>`. It counts pull
  requests, not commits, and says nothing about their size.
- **Others' PRs reviewed** is `reviewed-by:<login> -author:<login>` over pull
  requests in any state, so it can include open drafts such as #230 and #231.
  It excludes the member's own pull requests: GitHub records a reply in a
  review thread as a review, so plain `reviewed-by:` counts self-replies too
  (on 25 September it gave 62 for @t-shahan, 6 of them their own, and 7 for
  @threshi-art, 6 of them their own). It is a count of other people's pull
  requests with at least one review from that person, not of approvals or of
  review events. Cite this column, not a plain `reviewed-by:` count.
- **Closed issues authored** is `is:issue is:closed author:<login>`. It counts
  who opened the issue, not who fixed it.
- **Role** comes from [README § Team](../../../../README.md#team), which names
  only the three Unit 5 roles. The other four members' roles are in
  `docs/team.md`, which is still in draft
  [pull request #231](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/231).

**Contribution statements:** each paper copies the author's row in
`docs/team.md` word for word. That file is not on `main` yet
([#231](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/231), deadline for
confirming rows Sunday 27 September, week 8 count refresh after the freeze).
Until it merges, there is no row to copy.

## Answer quality (live evaluation)

All runs are the 20-case smoke tier: 12 answerable, 2 unanswerable, 3 prompt
injection, 3 ambiguous. The prompt-injection row is the share refused before
answer generation; whether generated prose resisted an injection is scored by
hand on each page. Twenty cases on a fictional corpus are evidence for that
sample, not a quality guarantee.

| Figure | Alpha (`v0.1.0-alpha.1`) | Beta (`v0.2.0`) | Final (`v1.0.0`) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Commit under test | `4e90382` (and `9871e3e`, the commit before #138, which scored the same) | `231e652`, [workflow run 36062704072](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/actions/runs/36062704072) | Pending — requires the 28 September candidate |
| Recall@5 (12 answerable) | 100% | 100% | Pending — requires the candidate smoke run ([#215](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/issues/215)) |
| Citation correctness (12 answerable) | 100% | 100% | Pending — same run |
| Grounded answer rate (12 answerable) | 100% | 100% | Pending — same run |

| Prompt-injection gate refusal (3 cases) | 0% | 100% | Pending — same run |
| Full tier | Not run | Not run | Pending — requires the first full-tier run through the workflow on the candidate ([#213](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/issues/213)) |
| Source | [live-evaluation.md](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/blob/v0.1.0-alpha.1/docs/alpha/live-evaluation.md), [results JSON](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/blob/v0.1.0-alpha.1/docs/alpha/live-evaluation-results.json); "The full tier has not been run" is in its limitations | [live-evaluation.md](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/blob/v0.2.0/docs/releases/v0.2.0/live-evaluation.md#results-against-the-alpha), [results JSON](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/blob/v0.2.0/docs/releases/v0.2.0/live-evaluation-results.json); full tier not run per [handoff.md](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/blob/v0.2.0/docs/releases/v0.2.0/handoff.md#what-this-beta-does-not-establish) | `docs/releases/v1.0.0/live-evaluation.md` (drafted in [#274](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/274)) |

Neither tagged release ran the full tier. One full-tier run did happen on the
host on 14 September, before #245 and #253 changed the refusal gate: all 46
answerable cases answered, and 0 of the 5 unanswerable and prompt-injection
cases refused ([comment on
#201](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/issues/201#issuecomment-5658446129)).
Its results are not committed, so it is a note, not a cell value.

The alpha folder moved from `docs/alpha/` to `docs/releases/v0.1.0-alpha.1/`
after the tag. The tagged links above point at the files as tagged; the
figures are the same in both places.

## Live benchmark against the pilot

The same bounded workload each time: at most 8 requests, a burst of 3, from
one operator's laptop. It checks that the deployed path works for one user
and a small burst. It is not a load test.

| Target | Agreed | Alpha, deployed `4352966` | Beta, deployed `231e652` | Final |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Generated time to first token, p50 | ≤ 4.0s | 1.21s, pass | 1.21s, pass | Pending — requires the candidate benchmark ([#215](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/issues/215)) |
| Generated total, max | ≤ 30.0s | 4.69s, pass | 4.35s, pass | Pending — same run |
| Cached time to first token, max | ≤ 1.5s | 0.04s, pass | 0.04s, pass | Pending — same run |
| Refused total, max | ≤ 3.0s | 0.31s, pass | 0.08s, pass | Pending — same run |
| Error rate | 0.0 | 0.00, pass | 0.00, pass | Pending — same run |
| Requests | — | 7 (5 generated, 1 cached, 1 refused), estimated cost $0.05 | 7 (5 generated, 1 cached, 1 refused), estimated cost $0.05 | Pending — same run |
| Source | [alpha live-benchmark.md § Targets](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/blob/v0.1.0-alpha.1/docs/alpha/live-benchmark.md#targets) | [live-benchmark.md](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/blob/v0.1.0-alpha.1/docs/alpha/live-benchmark.md#against-the-agreed-targets), [results JSON](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/blob/v0.1.0-alpha.1/docs/alpha/live-benchmark-results.json) | [live-benchmark.md](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/blob/v0.2.0/docs/releases/v0.2.0/live-benchmark.md#results), [results JSON](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/blob/v0.2.0/docs/releases/v0.2.0/live-benchmark-results.json) | `docs/releases/v1.0.0/live-benchmark.md` (drafted in [#274](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/274)) |

The beta's refusal step was refused at the cosine gate, so neither run times
a refusal by the coverage judge. Seven requests are too few for percentiles.

## Load, Lighthouse, and the deployed pilot

| Figure | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pilot load run: req/s, p50/p95 time to first token, errors, host CPU/memory | Pending — requires the load run against the pilot on the candidate ([issue #212](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/issues/212)) | Not measured at the beta: "The deployed system has not been load-tested" ([beta release notes](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/blob/v0.2.0/docs/releases/v0.2.0/release-notes.md#what-this-beta-does-not-establish)) |
| Synthetic load figures (not the pilot) | Generated answers saturate at 14.9 req/s on the default 40-thread pool; the refusal path reaches about 700 req/s. Model faked, database in memory, chat limiter off | [docs/load-testing.md](../../../load-testing.md). Do not cite these as the deployed system's capacity |
| Lighthouse, light theme (phone and desktop) | Pending — requires the Lighthouse run on the pilot ([issue #214](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/issues/214)) | Not measured at the beta ([beta handoff](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/blob/v0.2.0/docs/releases/v0.2.0/handoff.md#what-this-beta-does-not-establish)) |
| Lighthouse, dark theme (phone and desktop) | Pending — same run | Same |
| Deployed uptime | Pending — requires a host uptime record or monitoring export, sanitized into this folder at the freeze | Nothing committed |
| Auto-deploys since the alpha | Pending — requires a sanitized deploy journal from the pilot host that covers the time since the alpha tag (the freeze excerpt `auto-deploy-journal.txt` is [issue #207](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/issues/207)) | The deploy runs from a systemd timer on the host, not from Actions, so GitHub has no count of it. Gate text in [docs/ci-cd.md](../../../ci-cd.md) |

## Position-paper sections: where to draw from

| Paper section | Draw from (repo) | Named standards or external comparisons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Section 1: the product and the releases | [README](../../../../README.md); the alpha [handoff](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/blob/v0.1.0-alpha.1/docs/alpha/handoff.md) and [release notes](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/blob/v0.1.0-alpha.1/docs/alpha/release-notes.md); the beta [handoff](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/blob/v0.2.0/docs/releases/v0.2.0/handoff.md) and [release notes](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/blob/v0.2.0/docs/releases/v0.2.0/release-notes.md); the `v1.0.0` handoff and release notes once [#274](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/274) is filled and tagged | Keep claims to what a tagged or committed file shows |
| Section 2: quality and process | [docs/quality.md](../../../quality.md), with [docs/evaluation.md](../../../evaluation.md), [docs/ci-cd.md](../../../ci-cd.md), and this sheet for the figures | Compare quality.md against the **SEI CMMI** practice areas (for example Verification, Peer Review, Measurement and Analysis), or against **IEEE 730** (software quality assurance) and **IEEE 12207** (software life-cycle processes). Name the edition you cite |
| Section 3: industry context | The counts above, [README § Team](../../../../README.md#team), and [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the review and branch process | The **Stack Overflow Developer Survey**, **GitHub Octoverse**, or an **IEEE Computer Society** report. Name the year you cite |
| Contribution statement | The author's row in `docs/team.md`, copied as written ([#231](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/231)) | — |

Do not fill a Pending row from anything but the artifact it names. When that
artifact lands, replace the Pending text with the figure and point the Source
cell at the file or run.
