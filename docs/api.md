# API (for client authors)

This page is the client walkthrough. The machine-readable contract is
[openapi.json](openapi.json). Regenerate it with `make openapi`; CI fails if the
committed file is stale. The live console is `/docs` while the API is running
(`make stub` on :8000, password `dev`). Setup and the things that bite are in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

Send `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` on every route except
`/api/auth/login`, `/api/health`, and `/api/config`. History is stored on the
server: the client sends a question and a `session_id`, never a `chat_history`
array.

Ids, timestamps, tokens, and `corpus_version` change on every request. The
bodies below were taken from one stub run so the shapes are real.

## Rate limits and the error envelope

Errors use FastAPI's envelope: `{"detail": ...}`. `detail` is a string for
application errors and a list of `{loc, msg, type, ...}` objects for
validation (HTTP 422). A rate-limit response is HTTP 429 with
`{"error": "Rate limit exceeded: N per 1 minute"}`.

Limits are per remote address per API worker (slowapi's default store is
in-process). Defaults:

| Route | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /api/auth/login` | 10/minute |
| `POST /api/chat`, `POST /api/chat/stream` | `CHAT_RATE_LIMIT` (default 30/minute) |
| `POST /api/escalations`, `POST /api/escalations/{escalation_id}/retry-delivery` | 5/minute |
| `POST /api/documents/reindex` | `REINDEX_RATE_LIMIT` (default 2/minute) |

Missing bearer → `{"detail": "Not authenticated"}`. Bad or rotated token →
`{"detail": "Invalid or expired token."}`. Wrong password →
`{"detail": "Incorrect password."}`.

## Sign in

`POST /api/auth/login`

```http
POST /api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{"password": "dev"}
```

```json
{
  "access_token": "<access_token>",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

The live body is a JWT that lasts 24 hours; the example is a placeholder so
the committed page does not look like a leaked token. Rotating the password
hash revokes sessions bound to it. Paste a live token into `/docs` → Authorize
to call the rest of the console.

## Ask (SSE)

The UI uses `POST /api/chat/stream`. `POST /api/chat` is the same grounding
rule as a single JSON body, kept for tests and scripts.

`question` is 1–5000 characters. `session_id` is optional; when present it must
match `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]+$` (max 64). A newline in `session_id` is rejected.

### Stream

`POST /api/chat/stream` — `text/event-stream`. Each event is `data: <json>\n\n`.

```http
POST /api/chat/stream
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{"question": "Can I carry unused days?", "session_id": "7059759c-1f55-4812-852c-06a11bb5cc4b"}
```

The stub streams one chunk per word of the fake answer, then `done`, then
`follow_ups`:

```
data: {"chunk": "Based"}

data: {"chunk": " on"}

data: {"chunk": " the"}

…
data: {"done": true, "message_id": "75fa3bcb15324c9cae08d61b9adcbc23", "sources": ["Paid Time Off (PTO) Policy"], "confidence": 75, "refused": false}

data: {"follow_ups": ["How do I request time off?", "What happens to unused days when I leave?", "Do company holidays count against my balance?"]}
```

Every event type:

| Event | Payload |
| --- | --- |
| token | `{"chunk": "<text>"}` |
| finished | `{"done": true, "message_id": "<32 hex>", "sources": ["…"], "confidence": 75, "refused": false}` |
| finished from cache | same as finished, plus `"cached": true` |
| refused | `{"done": true, "message_id": "…", "sources": [], "confidence": <int>, "refused": true}` after one `chunk` that is the refusal text |
| suggestions | `{"follow_ups": ["…", "…", "…"]}` — omitted on refusal; may be skipped if the client hangs up after `done` |
| generation failure | `{"error": "An error occurred while generating the response."}` |

`message_id` names the assistant turn for escalation. Do not use list position.

### Non-streaming

`POST /api/chat`

```http
POST /api/chat
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{"question": "How much PTO do I get?", "session_id": "7059759c-1f55-4812-852c-06a11bb5cc4b"}
```

```json
{
  "answer": "Based on the policy documents provided, full-time employees accrue 15 days of paid time off per year for the first two years of service, rising to 20 days from year three and 25 days from year six. Accrual begins on your first day and there is no waiting period before you may use it. You may carry a maximum of 10 unused days into the following calendar year; anything above that is forfeited on December 31. This is drawn from the Paid Time Off (PTO) Policy, effective 2026-01-01. For absences longer than five consecutive business days you will also need approval from Human Resources.",
  "sources": ["Paid Time Off (PTO) Policy"],
  "confidence": 75,
  "follow_ups": [
    "How do I request time off?",
    "What happens to unused days when I leave?",
    "Do company holidays count against my balance?"
  ],
  "refused": false,
  "session_id": "7059759c-1f55-4812-852c-06a11bb5cc4b",
  "message_id": "11f49d3989164c59be28882a2f9ce9fd"
}
```

A refusal returns `refused: true`, empty `sources` / `follow_ups`, and the
fixed refusal text (it names Human Resources; see `REFUSAL_MESSAGE` in
`sourcebook/rag/config.py`). `message_id` is null when the request had no
session.

## Follow-up in a session

Create a session, then send the next question with the same `session_id`. The
server loads prior turns and may rewrite the retrieval query. There is no
client-supplied history field and no free-text "follow-ups" route — suggested
questions are just new `question` values.

`POST /api/conversations` then the stream above is the usual order. To reopen:

`GET /api/conversations/{session_id}`

```http
GET /api/conversations/7059759c-1f55-4812-852c-06a11bb5cc4b
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

```json
{
  "session_id": "7059759c-1f55-4812-852c-06a11bb5cc4b",
  "title": "PTO questions",
  "project_id": "1d91575f-a1d3-4bed-87db-3afe9af7cf60",
  "messages": [],
  "created_at": "2026-09-12T01:03:57.702699+00:00",
  "updated_at": "2026-09-12T01:03:57.702699+00:00"
}
```

After chat, `messages` holds the user turn and the assistant turn (with
`message_id`, `sources`, `confidence`, `refused`, `follow_ups`).

## Escalate

`POST /api/escalations` copies the question from the stored conversation. Send
`message_id` from `done` (or `message_index` only for turns persisted before
ids existed). `reason` is `refused` or `unhelpful`.

```http
POST /api/escalations
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "session_id": "7059759c-1f55-4812-852c-06a11bb5cc4b",
  "message_id": "11f49d3989164c59be28882a2f9ce9fd",
  "reason": "unhelpful",
  "note": "Need the carry-over rule in writing."
}
```

```json

  "status": "open",
  "reason": "unhelpful",

  "session_id": "7059759c-1f55-4812-852c-06a11bb5cc4b",
  "message_index": 1,
  "message_id": "11f49d3989164c59be28882a2f9ce9fd",
  "question": "How much PTO do I get?",
  "answer_excerpt": "Based on the policy documents provided, full-time employees accrue 15 days of paid time off per year for the first two years of service, rising to 20 days from year three and 25 days from year six.

  "refused": false,
  "confidence": 75,
  "sources": ["Paid Time Off (PTO) Policy"],
  "note": "Need the carry-over rule in writing.",
  "resolution": null,
  "created_at": "2026-09-12T01:04:16.973759+00:00",
  "updated_at": "2026-09-12T01:04:16.973759+00:00",
  "resolved_at": null,
  "delivery_status": "pending",
  "delivery_attempts": 0,
  "delivery_last_attempt_at": null,
  "delivery_claimed_at": null
}
```

Escalating the same message twice returns the first record. Create never waits
on the webhook.

## Human Resources queue and resolve

`GET /api/escalations?status=open` — newest first. Optional `session_id`,
`limit` 1–200 (default 50).

```http
GET /api/escalations?status=open
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "escalation_id": "da78161d307f40868c3b92db5e04223d",
      "status": "open",
      "reason": "unhelpful",
      "contact": "Human Resources",
      "session_id": "7059759c-1f55-4812-852c-06a11bb5cc4b",

      "delivery_attempts": 0,
      "delivery_last_attempt_at": null,
      "delivery_claimed_at": null
    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
```

`GET /api/escalations/{escalation_id}` returns that same record as an object.

`PATCH /api/escalations/{escalation_id}`

```http
PATCH /api/escalations/da78161d307f40868c3b92db5e04223d
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{"status": "resolved", "resolution": "Pointed them at the PTO policy carry-over section."}
```

```json
{"status": "resolved", "resolution": "Pointed them at the PTO policy carry-over section.", "resolved_at": "2026-09-12T01:04:16.985959+00:00"}
```

(The live body is the full record with `status`, `resolution`, and `resolved_at`
updated.)

`POST /api/escalations/{escalation_id}/retry-delivery` re-sends a failed
webhook. With no webhook configured the stub returns:

```json
{"detail": "Webhook delivery is not configured."}
```

## Query-log report

There is no HTTP report route on this OpenAPI document. Every chat request
writes one `query_logs` row (question hash, scores, refused, sources, cache
hit, latency). How that log is used is in the README section
[Learning from the query log](../README.md#learning-from-the-query-log). A
weekly knowledge-gap report over that collection is tracked separately as
[#160](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/issues/160).

## Health and config

`GET /api/health`

```json
{"status": "ok"}
```

`GET /api/config`

```json
{"app_name": "Sourcebook", "similarity_threshold": 0.62}
```

## Conversations

`GET /api/conversations` — sidebar rows, no `messages`. Unresolved
`project_id` values are returned as `null`.

```json
[
  {
    "session_id": "320b424b-a3a0-4686-941d-860aa8552c82",
    "title": "PTO questions",
    "project_id": "1d91575f-a1d3-4bed-87db-3afe9af7cf60",
    "updated_at": "2026-09-12T01:03:57.702699+00:00"
  }
]
```

`POST /api/conversations`

```http
POST /api/conversations
{"title": "PTO questions", "project_id": "1d91575f-a1d3-4bed-87db-3afe9af7cf60"}
```

```json
{
  "session_id": "320b424b-a3a0-4686-941d-860aa8552c82",
  "title": "PTO questions",
  "project_id": "1d91575f-a1d3-4bed-87db-3afe9af7cf60",
  "messages": [],
  "created_at": "2026-09-12T01:03:57.702699+00:00",
  "updated_at": "2026-09-12T01:03:57.702699+00:00"
}
```

`PATCH /api/conversations/{session_id}` with `{"title": "PTO follow-up"}` or
`{"project_id": null}` to unassign → `{"ok": true}`.

`DELETE /api/conversations/{session_id}` → `{"ok": true}`.

Unknown session or project → `{"detail": "Conversation not found."}` or
`{"detail": "Project not found."}`.

## Documents

`GET /api/documents` — `q` (title substring), `category`, `limit` (default 50,
max 200), `skip`.

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "source": "documents/pto-policy.md",
      "doc_id": "pto-policy",
      "title": "Paid Time Off (PTO) Policy",
      "category": "Time Off & Leave",
      "owner": "Human Resources",
      "effective_date": "2026-01-01",
      "passage_count": 1,
      "preview": "Full-time employees accrue 15 days of PTO per year."
    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
```

`GET /api/documents/categories` → `["Time Off & Leave"]`.

`GET /api/documents/body?source=documents/pto-policy.md`

```json
{
  "source": "documents/pto-policy.md",
  "body": "## Overview\n\nFull-time employees accrue 15 days of paid time off per year."
}
```

`GET /api/documents/passages?source=documents/pto-policy.md` → the ordered
passage strings retrieval sees.

`POST /api/documents/reindex` rebuilds the library and bumps the corpus
version (that is what invalidates the answer cache):

```json
{"ok": true, "documents": 1, "corpus_version": "f971481377004fb3a3fce267dc5facd3"}
```

## Projects

`GET /api/projects`

```json
[
  {
    "project_id": "1d91575f-a1d3-4bed-87db-3afe9af7cf60",
    "name": "Onboarding",
    "created_at": "2026-09-12T01:03:57.697874+00:00"
  }
]
```

`POST /api/projects` with `{"name": "Onboarding"}` returns one of those
objects. `DELETE /api/projects/{project_id}` unassigns its conversations and
returns `{"ok": true}`.
