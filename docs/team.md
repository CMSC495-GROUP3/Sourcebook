# Team and individual contributions

CMSC 495 Group 3. This page is the per-person record that the README [Team](../README.md#team) section summarizes.

Counts below are a snapshot against canonical `origin/main` at
[`88e8a13`](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/commit/88e8a134d16e092b2307c51b4e2a5fd7a9af39be)
(commit date 2026-09-15), taken on 2026-09-17. Work merged after that commit is
noted in the rows below but is not in the counts.

| How counted | Command or query |
| --- | --- |
| Author commits | `git log --no-merges --format='%an <%ae>'` on `88e8a13`, grouped by person |
| Merged pull requests authored | `gh` search `repo:CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook type:pr author:<login> is:merged` |
| Pull requests reviewed | `gh` search `repo:CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook type:pr reviewed-by:<login>` |
| Issues assigned | `gh issue list --assignee <login> --state all` on this repository |

Several people commit under more than one Git name. Author commits are grouped by person: `t-shahan`, `Taylor`, `Taylor Shahan`, and `Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>` under **Taylor Shahan**; `Lokias` under **Chris**; `RoNUO` under **Rob**; `DanielTsang26` and `Daniel Tsang` under **Daniel Tsang**. `dependabot[bot]` is not grouped with anyone.

`dependabot[bot]` has 18 author commits and 18 merged PRs on the same snapshot. It is not a team member.

Grouped this way, that commit shows five people plus Dependabot. Gavin and Dominick had no author commits on `main` at the snapshot; Gavin's first commits landed later (see his row).

## Taylor Shahan

**Owns, per the README.** Module boundaries in `sourcebook/`, the split between the API and `web/`, the deployment shape, and the architecture diagrams.

- Follow-up grounding on the question as asked, [PR #245](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/245), which closed [issue #189](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/issues/189).

The 16 `Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`-authored commits at the `88e8a13` snapshot (JWT `exp` work from [PR #154](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/154), facing-page icon fix [PR #202](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/202), lock-check follow-up on [PR #157](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/157), second-password and auto-deploy follow-ups) are counted with Taylor, as [issue #201](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/issues/201) asked; Taylor directed that work and is accountable for it.

## Chris

**Owns, per the README.** Evaluation, verifying merged work as one system, and the evidence behind any release claim. Day-to-day integration.

**What `main` shows.** Second-largest author share. Git records these commits under the name `Lokias`. Representative merged work:

- Offline ingestion tests, [PR #2](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/2).
- Forwarded-client IP trust, [PR #54](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/54).
- Provider timeout and a separate login pool, [PR #112](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/112).
- Citation measurement split from retrieval, [PR #111](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/111); evaluation by category, [PR #140](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/140).
- Clarify-and-escalate prompt, [PR #138](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/138); lifecycle corpus, [PR #139](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/139).
- Empty-corpus library cleanup, [PR #132](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/132); prompt-injection hygiene for retrieved text, [PR #155](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/155).
- Query-log analysis reports, [PR #171](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/171) / [issue #160](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/issues/160).

After the snapshot: the grounding-gate fix for [issue #192](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/issues/192), [PR #253](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/253), merged on 2026-09-22 and is not in the counts above. [Issue #189](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/issues/189) is closed; it was completed by Taylor's [PR #245](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/245), so it is not counted as Chris's merged authorship.

## Daniel Tsang

**Owns, per the README.** Endpoint shapes, streaming events, the `LLMProvider` interface, and stored record shapes. CODEOWNERS lists [@DanielTsang26](https://github.com/DanielTsang26) as a required reviewer on every path, with Taylor and George.

**What `main` shows.**

- `101df59` `Initial commit`.
- `c00b30c` facing-page topic-list alignment, the fix recorded on [issue #175](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/issues/175).
- Merged: [PR #234](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/234) mobile drawer height (`h-screen` to `h-svh`; `5f96f1f`, `c2926c2`), committed under the name `DanielTsang26`.
- One review: [PR #170](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/170) (escalation contact rename).

Interface-contract work on `main` also appears in PRs Taylor or Chris authored; those PRs stay credited to their authors.

## George Struder

**Owns, per the README.** Administration, dependency locks, and the MongoDB deployment.

**What `main` shows.** Eleven author commits, including lock generation and the Linux lock refresh, the pip-compile CI check, escalation contact from config, the People Operations to Human Resources rename, the pydantic-core pin revert, and disabling the embedding cache in live evaluation. Merged PRs:

- [PR #157](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/157) lock the Python dependencies.
- [PR #170](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/170) escalation contact rename.
- [PR #244](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/244) disable embedding cache in the live evaluation workflow.

Reviews: [PR #173](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/173) (Dependabot Python group), [PR #197](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/197) (Atlas access-list admission), and [PR #219](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/219) (Atlas admin API access-list notes; [issue #218](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/issues/218) is closed). After the snapshot he also approved [PR #253](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/253) before merging it; that review is not in the count of 3.

**Infrastructure and configuration recorded in issues.** Most of George's operations work happened on the EC2 instance and in the Atlas and GitHub settings, so it shows up in issue comments rather than commits:

- Root disk on the EC2 instance: grew the EBS volume from 8 GB to 16 GB, extended the root partition, and enabled the weekly Docker prune timer ([issue #79](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/issues/79#issuecomment-5553669326)).
- Verified the three auto-deploy paths on the instance from its deploy logs ([issue #80](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/issues/80#issuecomment-5560512370)).
- Added the three evaluation secrets to the repository for [PR #197](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/197#issuecomment-5641222971).
- Confirmed that the runner's IP is added to and removed from the Atlas access list during an evaluation run, and checked the roles on the organization and project API keys ([issue #218](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/issues/218#issuecomment-5657834042)).
- Reported that the read-only evaluation database user could not write the embedding cache ([issue #243](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/issues/243)), then fixed it in [PR #244](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/244).
- Merged [PR #197](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/197), [PR #219](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/219), and, after the snapshot, [PR #253](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/253) into `main`.

George also lists EC2 and S3 setup and administration in his [comment on PR #231](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/231#issuecomment-5782718490). The items above are the parts of that work with a GitHub record.

It put his first two author commits on `main`: `0b4c34f` (HR escalation queue) and `8fd1cf6` (escalation page lint fix). They are not in the counts above.

Assigned [#82](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/issues/82) is ownership, not merged credit; the merged streaming-blank fix is [PR #126](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/126) (Taylor). The merged open-book implementation on `main` is [PR #161](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/pull/161) (Taylor) and is credited to Taylor.
