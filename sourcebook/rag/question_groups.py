"""Group query-log questions by meaning for the What People Ask page.

``question_hash`` groups rows whose condensed question is the same text after
``cache.normalize``. That is the right key for a cache and the wrong one for a
report: "How much PTO do I get?" and "How many vacation days do I have?" are
one question to Human Resources and two hashes to the log. This module merges
hash groups whose embeddings are close (issue #287).

## The pass

Wordings are taken in count order, most asked first. Each one joins the
existing group whose leader, its first and most asked wording, it matches at
``threshold`` cosine or above, the closest leader if several do. Otherwise it
leads a new group. Comparing against the leader only, never against the other
members, stops a chain of near neighbours from drifting into one group that
covers three topics.

The order and the tie-breaks are fixed, so the same log gives the same page.
A wording with no vector (no text was logged, or the provider could not embed
it) stays in a group of its own.

This is pure Python on purpose: the API image has no numpy. The worst case at
the report's cap is 200 wordings with no two alike, about 20,000 dot products
of 1,536 dimensions, which took 0.35 s on a laptop.
