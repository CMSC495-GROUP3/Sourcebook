"""Coverage report — the query log's read side, for the What People Ask page.

Every chat request writes a ``query_logs`` row (see ``sourcebook.api.analytics``).
``sourcebook.rag.query_log_reports`` already ranks those rows for an operator at
a terminal on the EC2 host. This route runs the same two ranking pipelines for
the web app, so Human Resources can see which questions the corpus does not
cover without a shell:

- ``gaps``: refused questions grouped by ``question_hash``, most frequent
  first. Each is a candidate for a new or clearer policy.
- ``faq``: questions asked at least twice, answered or not, with how many of
  those asks were refused.

The window counts back ``days`` from now, at most 90. ``query_logs`` rows
expire after ``QUERY_LOG_TTL_SECONDS``, so a window longer than the TTL is
shortened to it and the response's ``days`` says what was used. The bound on
the parameter stays fixed, so a short TTL cannot turn every request into a 422.

Question text is the logged ``question_condensed`` (the standalone rewrite that
the hash groups on), falling back to the truncated ``question_raw``. Nothing
here writes, and no session id leaves the server.
