"""Coverage report — the query log's read side, for the What People Ask page.

Every chat request writes a ``query_logs`` row (see ``sourcebook.api.analytics``).
``sourcebook.rag.query_log_reports`` already ranks those rows for an operator at
a terminal on the EC2 host. This route ranks them for the web app, so Human
Resources can see which questions the corpus does not cover without a shell:

- ``gaps``: refused questions, most asked first. Each is a candidate for a new
  or clearer policy.
- ``faq``: questions asked in at least two conversations, answered or not,
  most conversations first, with how many of those asks were refused.

Both lists group by meaning, not exact wording (issue #287). The log's
``question_hash`` groups identical text; ``sourcebook.rag.question_groups``
then merges hash groups whose question embeddings are within
``QUESTION_GROUP_THRESHOLD`` cosine. Most vectors are already in
``embedding_cache``, because retrieval embedded the same condensed text. The
rest are embedded in one ``embed_many`` call and not stored, so this route
never writes. If that call fails, the lists fall back to exact wording and
``grouping`` in the response says ``"exact"``: a busy provider must not take
the report down.

Only the ``CANDIDATE_LIMIT`` most asked hash groups per list are grouped. A
wording outside that cap cannot join a group, which at pilot volume is every
wording there is.

The window counts back ``days`` from now, at most 90. ``query_logs`` rows
expire after ``QUERY_LOG_TTL_SECONDS``, so a window longer than the TTL is
shortened to it and the response's ``days`` says what was used. The bound on
the parameter stays fixed, so a short TTL cannot turn every request into a 422.

Question text is the logged ``question_condensed`` (the standalone rewrite that
the hash groups on), falling back to the truncated ``question_raw``. No
session id leaves the server; sessions are only counted.
