"""Escalation delivery — makes a stored escalation reach a person.

The database is the system of record; this module only carries the record to
wherever someone will see it. Delivery runs as a FastAPI background task after
the response is sent, so the employee never waits on a third-party HTTP call,
and a failure here is logged rather than raised. The escalation is already
stored, and a webhook outage must not turn a successful hand-off into an error.
Callers persist the Boolean result as delivery status on the escalation record.

The payload has a top-level `text` field so Slack and Teams incoming webhooks
render it as a message with no adapter. Any other receiver can read the full
`escalation` object beside it. Never log or return the webhook URL.
