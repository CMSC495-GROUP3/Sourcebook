"""Query logging — the substrate for "learn from interaction patterns".

One record per chat request. Nothing here changes an answer; it records what
happened so the system can be improved from evidence rather than from guesses.

Three things it is designed to answer:

1. **What can the assistant not answer?** Refusals grouped by question hash are
   a ranked list of the documents HR should write next. This is the closest
   thing the system has to learning: the corpus improves because the logs said
   where it was thin.
2. **What gets asked repeatedly?** High-count question hashes are the FAQ, and
   the questions worth curating a canonical answer for.
3. **Is the threshold set correctly?** The score distribution of answered versus
   refused questions is exactly what SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD should be tuned
   against, and it cannot be collected any other way.

## Logging never breaks a chat request

Every write is wrapped. An analytics failure must not turn a working answer into
an error, so failures are logged and swallowed. That is a deliberate exception
to the project's usual rule against swallowing errors: the alternative is losing
a user's answer to a bookkeeping problem.
