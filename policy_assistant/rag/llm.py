"""Model provider interface.

Vendor lock-in mitigation from the proposal: every model call in this codebase
goes through the LLMProvider interface below, so swapping OpenAI for a
self-hosted model means writing one new subclass and changing one environment
variable. No module outside this file names a vendor or a model.

Two logical roles are exposed instead of concrete model names:

    "answer"  — the grounded response shown to the user. Quality matters most.
    "utility" — cheap internal calls (query rewriting, follow-up suggestions).
                A smaller, faster model is appropriate here.

A provider maps those roles onto whatever models it actually has.
