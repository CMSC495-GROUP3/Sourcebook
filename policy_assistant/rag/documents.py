"""Document parsing — the abstraction layer over source formats.

Every source document, whatever its original format, is reduced to one shape:

    {doc_id, title, category, owner, effective_date, body}

which the embedding step then splits into passages that each carry a copy of
that metadata. The same shape, body included, is stored once per document so
the Policy Library can show the document whole. Downstream code never has to
know where a passage came from or what format it started in.

Documents are plain UTF-8 text with a short header block, blank line, then body:

    Title: Paid Time Off (PTO) Policy
    Category: Time Off & Leave
    Owner: People Operations
    Effective: 2026-01-01

    Full-time employees accrue...

Only Title is required. To support a new input format (PDF, DOCX, Confluence
export), convert it to this shape and the rest of the pipeline is unchanged.
