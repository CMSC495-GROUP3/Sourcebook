"""JWT signing and verification, shared by login, the auth dependency, and the
rate-limit log line.

One module knows the algorithm and where the secret comes from, so the three
callers cannot drift (issue #146). The secret is read on every call rather
than at import: main.py refuses to start without it, so the read never fails
in a running process, and reading late means a test or the load-test stub can
set the variable without re-importing the package.

This module imports nothing from the rest of the API package on purpose.
auth.py imports the limiter and deps.py imports auth.py, so anything they both
need has to sit below both of them.
