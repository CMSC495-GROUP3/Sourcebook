"""Collection handles for the backend.

The client itself lives in `rag/mongo.py` and is shared with the ingestion
scripts, so the whole process holds exactly one connection pool. See that
module for the connection budget and the fork-safety reasoning.

Index creation is deliberately *not* run at import. It performs real I/O, and
doing I/O at import means a database problem surfaces as an confusing traceback
during module loading rather than as a clear startup failure. `main.py` calls
`ensure_indexes()` from the application lifespan instead.
