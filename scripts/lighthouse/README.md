# Lighthouse runs

`run.mjs` runs Lighthouse against a running Sourcebook for
[#214](https://github.com/CMSC495-GROUP3/Sourcebook/issues/214): the sign-in
page, the chat page with one answered question, and the Policy Library with a
document open, each in the light and dark theme, at Lighthouse's mobile and
desktop presets. That is 12 runs, each scored on performance, accessibility,
best practices, and SEO.

The script signs in through the API, asks one question so the chat page has
an answer, and picks a document. Against the pilot, that is one real model
call, and it leaves a conversation titled "Lighthouse run". Before each audit it
stores the theme, and for signed-in pages the token, in the browser, and runs
Lighthouse with storage reset off so they survive.

## Running it

It needs Node 22.19 or later and a Chrome or Chromium binary.

```bash
cd scripts/lighthouse
npm ci
BASE_URL=https://sourcebook.duckdns.org \
LH_PASSWORD='<reviewer password>' \
CHROME_PATH=/path/to/chrome \
node run.mjs
```

Never commit the password. Results go to `results/<timestamp>/`, which git
ignores:

- `summary.md`: the table to copy into `docs/quality.md`, with the date and
  the deployed commit
- `summary.json`: the same scores, plus the conversation and document used
- one Lighthouse JSON report per run, which opens in the
  [Lighthouse viewer](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse-viewer/)

To try it without the pilot, run `make stub`, build the web app
(`cd web && npm run build`), serve it with `npx vite preview` (it proxies
`/api` to the stub), and point `BASE_URL` at `http://localhost:4173` with
`LH_PASSWORD=dev`. Local scores leave out the pilot's network, TLS, and
server, so quote only the pilot run.
