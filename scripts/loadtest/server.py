"""Load-test server: the real application with its external services stubbed.

Run it:

    ./.venv/bin/uvicorn scripts.loadtest.server:app --port 8001
    ./.venv/bin/uvicorn scripts.loadtest.server:app --port 8001 --workers 4

## What this measures, and what it does not

It measures the **concurrency architecture** — how many simultaneous SSE
streams one process can serve, and what happens to latency past that point.
That is the property the async conversion changes, and it is reproducible on a
laptop with no cloud account.

It does **not** measure end-to-end production latency. Stubbed out:

- **The model.** `LLM_PROVIDER=fake` generates a canned answer at a configurable
  per-token delay, so a request occupies a worker for a realistic duration
  without any spend. Real OpenAI latency has a long tail this does not
  reproduce.
- **MongoDB.** Replaced with an in-memory dict plus a fixed simulated latency.
  Real Atlas round-trips vary and would themselves consume threads.
- **Atlas Vector Search.** Replaced with canned passages. `$vectorSearch` is an
  Atlas-only aggregation stage and cannot run locally at all.

The stubs live in this file rather than behind flags in `policy_assistant/` so that no
test-only branch can ever be reached in production.

## Reading the gate

Fake embeddings are meaningless, so a similarity score computed from them is
noise. Rather than fake the gate, bracket it — run the whole test twice:

    SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.0   every request generates      (worst case)
    SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=1.0   every request refuses        (best case)

Real traffic sits between the two, weighted by the actual refusal rate.
