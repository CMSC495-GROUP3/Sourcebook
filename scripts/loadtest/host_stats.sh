# One CSV row per container per sample: UTC time, the 1-minute load average,
# the container name, and what `docker stats` reports for it. Container names
# carry the Compose project, so the file says which API container was busy.
# Nothing in it identifies a user or a request.
#
# `docker stats --no-stream` takes a second or two to sample CPU, so rows land
# every INTERVAL plus that, and each row's time is when its sample began. A
# failed sample (the daemon busy, a container being recreated) writes one
# docker-stats-failed row and the sampler keeps going.
